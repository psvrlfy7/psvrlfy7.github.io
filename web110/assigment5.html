        <strong>Activity 1: TutorialsPoint Social Networking Tutorial</strong><br />
        In this activity, I completed the tutorial about social networking on TutorialsPoint. I learned about different social media sites and their main features. After reading, I decided that Facebook, Instagram, and LinkedIn are the most interesting to me because they help connect with friends, share photos, and create professional contacts. This knowledge helps me understand which platforms I should focus on for personal and professional use in the future.

        <strong>Activity 2: GCFLearnFree Facebook Tutorial</strong><br />
        I followed the Facebook tutorial and created an account. I learned how to set up a profile, add friends, and share posts. This was useful because I now know how to use Facebook for staying in touch with family and friends. I think this will be helpful for me to communicate better and keep updated with people in my life.

        <strong>Activity 3: Smart Insights Honeycomb Model</strong><br />
        In this activity, I reviewed the Honeycomb model of social media. I evaluated popular social media sites like Facebook, Instagram, LinkedIn, and Twitter based on features like identity, conversations, and sharing. I learned that Facebook and Instagram support most of the honeycomb elements, while some other sites lack in areas like presence or reputation. This helps me understand how social media sites are designed to meet different user needs and which ones are better for certain activities.
