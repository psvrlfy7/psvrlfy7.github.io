    <h1>Assignment 4: Email Activities Summary</h1>

    <p><strong>Activity: Sending and Receiving Email</strong><br>
    In this activity, I learned how to send, receive, and reply to emails using my email account. I signed up for a Gmail account and practiced sending messages. This helped me understand how email communication works in everyday life. I also learned the importance of replying to emails in a timely and polite manner. I think this skill will be very useful in my future work and personal communication because email is a common way to share information quickly.</p>

    <p><strong>Activity: Using an Email Client Program (Mozilla Thunderbird)</strong><br>
    For this activity, I installed Mozilla Thunderbird and configured it to connect to my email account. I learned how to use Thunderbird to send and receive emails instead of using the web interface. This is helpful because email clients offer more features and can manage multiple email accounts in one place. I also viewed email message headers to check the details about the sender and learned about email spoofing, which means fake emails. Knowing this helps me stay safe and avoid phishing scams. I can use this knowledge to protect myself from suspicious emails in the future.</p>
