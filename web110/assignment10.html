    <p style="color: #cc0000; font-style: italic; background-color: #fff0f5;">
        In this assignment, I learned how to use external, internal, and inline CSS to control the appearance of 
        web pages. I practiced creating an external stylesheet and linking it to multiple HTML files, 
        which allows for consistent styling across all pages. I also explored how internal CSS can override 
        styles for specific elements on a page and how inline CSS can be used to customize individual elements. 
        By completing these activities, I now have a better understanding of how CSS works, how to structure 
        styles efficiently, and how to make my web pages more visually appealing and user-friendly. 
        These skills are important for developing websites professionally and will help me in future 
        projects by saving time and ensuring consistent design across multiple pages.
