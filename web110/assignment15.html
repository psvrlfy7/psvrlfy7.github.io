    <h1>My IT Career Plan</h1>

    <p>
        My career objective is to become a skilled web developer specializing in front-end and full-stack development. 
        I plan to enhance my skills in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and modern frameworks like React and Node.js, 
        while also building a strong portfolio of projects to demonstrate my abilities to potential employers.
    </p>

    <p>
        You can view my professional profile on LinkedIn: 
        <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/pavlo-sverdzolka-45840435a/" target="_blank">My LinkedIn</a>
    </p>

    <p>
        While completing this assignment, I learned how to structure a web page using proper HTML semantics, 
        link external CSS stylesheets, and include hyperlinks to professional profiles. 
        This knowledge helps me professionally by allowing me to present my career goals and achievements clearly online, 
        which is essential for networking and job opportunities in IT.
