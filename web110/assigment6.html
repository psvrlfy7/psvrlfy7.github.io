    <h1>Assignment 6 Summary</h1>

    <p><strong>Activity: TutorialsPoint: Internet Services</strong><br />
    In this activity, I learned about different internet services like email, FTP, VoIP, and web hosting. I understood how these services help people communicate and share information online. This knowledge is useful for me because I can better understand how the internet works and apply it when I use different online tools in my studies or work.</p>

    <p><strong>Activity: GCFLearnFree: WhatsApp</strong><br />
    I completed the WhatsApp tutorial where I learned how to send messages and call friends using this app. WhatsApp is easy to use and very popular for quick communication. I think I can use WhatsApp to stay in touch with classmates and colleagues, especially for group projects or fast updates.</p>

    <p><strong>Activity: Research remote desktop applications (Chrome Remote Desktop)</strong><br />
    I researched Chrome Remote Desktop and learned how it allows remote access to other computers. This is helpful when needing technical support or accessing files from another location. I imagine this tool will be useful for me in the future if I need help fixing my computer or need to work remotely on a different device.</p>
