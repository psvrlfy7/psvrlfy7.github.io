    <h1>Assignment 7 Summary</h1>

    <p><strong>Activity 1: TutorialsPoint - Internet Protocols</strong><br>
    In this activity, I learned about different Internet protocols such as TCP/IP, UDP, HTTP, and FTP. These protocols are important because they help computers communicate over the Internet. I understood how TCP/IP works as the basic protocol that allows data to be sent in small packets between devices. Learning about these protocols helped me see how information travels across networks reliably and securely. I think this knowledge is useful for troubleshooting network problems or setting up new networks in the future, especially if I work in IT or tech support.</p>

    <p><strong>Activity 2: Review IP Address Settings on Windows</strong><br>
    This activity showed me how to check and manage IP address settings on a Windows computer using tools like ipconfig. I learned how to see my current IP address, release it, and renew it, which can help fix connection issues. It was useful to understand the difference between static and dynamic IP addresses and how DHCP works to assign IPs automatically. Knowing this helps me better understand how my home or office network works and how to fix problems if I canâ€™t connect to the Internet.</p>

    <p><strong>Activity 3: Share a Folder on Windows</strong><br>
    In this activity, I learned how to share a folder on my Windows PC and allow other computers to access it on the same network. I used the File Sharing feature and also learned the command-line way using net share and net use commands. Sharing files between computers can be very useful for working in teams or sharing documents at home. I see myself applying this in the future when I want to easily transfer files without using email or USB drives.</p>
