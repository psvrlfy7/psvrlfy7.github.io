        <strong>Activity: TutorialsPoint - Internet Reference Models</strong><br />
        In this activity, I learned about different internet reference models like OSI and TCP/IP. These models explain how data travels across networks in layers. Understanding these layers helps me know how devices communicate and how data is processed step by step. I can use this knowledge when working with networks or troubleshooting internet problems in the future.

        <strong>Activity: Verify Internet Connectivity using Ping and Tracert</strong><br />
        This activity taught me how to check if my computer is connected to the internet using tools like ping and tracert. Ping helps to test if a device is reachable, while tracert shows the path data takes to reach an internet host. Knowing how to use these tools will help me diagnose network issues quickly and better understand how internet traffic flows.

        <strong>Activity: Share a Folder and Connect to Shared Folder (Windows GUI)</strong><br />
        I learned how to share a folder on my computer and connect to it from another device using the Windows interface. This is useful for sharing files in a home or work network without using email or cloud services. I see myself using this skill to share documents easily with friends or colleagues on the same network.
