    <h1>Assignment 9</h1>
    <p>
        In this assignment, I learned how to create basic HTML pages, organize files, 
        and add headings, paragraphs, and links. I also practiced checking my HTML for 
        errors and updating my files using Bitbucket and Visual Studio Code. 
        These skills will help me understand web development better 
        and use HTML in future school or work projects.
