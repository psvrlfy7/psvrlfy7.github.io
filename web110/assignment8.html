    <h2>Assignment 8 Summary</h2>

    <p><strong>Activity 1: GCFLearnFree Internet Safety Tutorial</strong><br>
    This activity was about learning the basics of internet safety. I learned important things like how to protect my personal information online, recognize phishing attempts, and create strong passwords. The tutorial also explained how to avoid scams and the importance of keeping software up to date. I found it useful because it helped me understand why security matters for everyone using the internet. I plan to apply this knowledge by being more careful about the websites I visit and the information I share, both on social media and other sites. This will help me avoid online risks and keep my personal data safe in my everyday internet use.</p>

    <p><strong>Activity 2: Browser Safety Practice</strong><br>
    In this activity, I reviewed how to improve security in web browsers. I learned how to check if my browser is up to date, disable unneeded add-ons, clear browser history and cookies, and use private browsing or incognito mode to protect my privacy. I also learned how to check the security certificate of a website to know if it is safe to visit. This activity helped me understand that browsers have many settings to protect users and keep their information private. I will apply this by regularly updating my browser, managing add-ons carefully, and using private browsing when needed to keep my online activity more secure.</p>

    <p><strong>Activity 3: Researching Password Managers and Multi-Factor Authentication</strong><br>
    For this activity, I researched password managers and multi-factor authentication (MFA). I learned that password managers help create and store strong passwords safely so that you don't have to remember them all. Multi-factor authentication adds an extra layer of security by requiring a second step, like a code sent to your phone, when logging into accounts. This is very important for protecting important accounts like email, social media, and banking. I plan to set up a password manager and enable MFA on my main accounts to improve my security. This will make it harder for hackers to access my personal information and accounts.</p>
