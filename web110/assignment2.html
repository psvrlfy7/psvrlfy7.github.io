    <h1>Assignment 2: Web Browsers - Learning Summary</h1>

    <h2>Activity 1: Install multiple web browsers to compare the different programs – Chrome</h2>
    <p><strong>Topic:</strong> Comparing web browsers</p>
    <p><strong>What I learned:</strong><br>
    While installing Google Chrome, I got a better idea of how different browsers work and what features they offer. Chrome is fast, easy to set up, and works smoothly with other Google services like Gmail and Google Drive. Compared to browsers like Safari or Edge, Chrome feels more flexible, especially with the wide range of available extensions and tools for developers.</p>
    <p><strong>How I can use this:</strong><br>
    I can use Chrome as my main browser, especially when I need access to developer tools or specific browser extensions. Knowing how different browsers work is also useful for checking how websites look and behave across platforms, which is important for school or future web projects.</p>

    <h2>Activity 2: Practice using web browsers – macOS</h2>
    <p><strong>Topic:</strong> Learning browser features on macOS</p>
    <p><strong>What I learned:</strong><br>
    Using a browser on macOS helped me see how the interface and shortcuts are a little different from Windows. For example, Safari on Mac has its own way of managing tabs, downloads, and settings. I also practiced using features like private browsing, bookmarks, and browsing history. These small things help me browse more efficiently.</p>
    <p><strong>How I can use this:</strong><br>
    In the future, if I work on a Mac or help someone who uses one, I’ll be more confident with the browser setup. It also makes me more flexible when switching between operating systems and helps me adjust quickly to different tech environments.</p>

    <h2>Activity 3: Configure browser settings – Chrome</h2>
    <p><strong>Topic:</strong> Changing Chrome settings for better use</p>
    <p><strong>What I learned:</strong><br>
    In this activity, I explored the settings menu in Chrome. I changed the default search engine, looked at how to manage saved passwords, and updated privacy settings. I also learned how to clear cache and cookies and block pop-ups. These features help make browsing safer and more comfortable.</p>
    <p><strong>How I can use this:</strong><br>
    I can apply this by customizing Chrome for better performance and privacy. For example, I can turn off tracking, block annoying pop-ups, and make sure my passwords are safe. This is especially helpful when I work on shared or public computers.</p>
