        CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is a style-sheet language used to control the
        appearance of web pages. While HTML provides the structure of a
        page — such as headings, paragraphs, and images — CSS is
        responsible for the visual design.

        With CSS, you can change colors, fonts, text sizes,
        backgrounds, spacing, borders, and the layout of elements on
        the screen. Before CSS, web pages looked plain and mostly text-based,
        but CSS makes modern websites visually appealing and easier to use.

        The term “cascading” refers to the way CSS styles are
        applied in layers. Styles can come from external files,
        internal code, or inline attributes, and the browser determines
        which style has the highest priority. This system gives developers
        flexibility and control when designing pages.
