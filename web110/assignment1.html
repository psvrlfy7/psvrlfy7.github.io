Topic: Creating a GitHub Account and Repository

I learned how to create a GitHub account and set up a private repository. This process helped me 
understand why version control is important for managing projects. With a private repository, I can keep my 
code safe and organized, which is very useful when working on different tasks or with a team. I also 
practiced adding important files like README and index.html to my repository. This gave me hands-on 
experience with Git commands and made me more confident in using Git-based systems. Knowing how to 
manage repositories will help me in future projects where tracking changes and collaborating with others is necessary.

Topic: Using GitHub Pages for Website Hosting

I discovered how to use GitHub Pages to host simple websites for free. By placing the index.html file in the 
main branch of my repository and enabling GitHub Pages in the settings, I was able to publish my website 
online. This was exciting because it means I can share my projects or portfolio with others easily. I also 
learned that it takes some time for the website to appear after setting it up, which is useful to know. This 
skill is valuable because creating and publishing websites is an important part of web development, and 
having a free hosting option is very convenient for beginners like me.

Topic: Writing a Learning Summary

While completing these activities, I wrote a summary of what I learned and how I can apply it. Writing this 
summary helped me reflect on my learning process and improved my ability to communicate clearly. It 
made me think about how the knowledge I gained can be useful in real situations, such as managing 
projects or sharing my work online. I believe that regularly writing summaries like this will make me a better 
learner and developer. It helps me organize my thoughts and remember important concepts, which will be 
helpful throughout my career.
