    <h1>Assignment 3 Summary: Search Engines</h1>
    <p>
        For this assignment, I completed several activities to learn more about search engines and how they work. These activities helped me understand the differences between popular search engines, how to use advanced search techniques, and the basics of artificial intelligence in search.

    <p>
        First, I compared search engines like Google, Bing, Yahoo, and Ask by searching for "web search engine." I noticed that Google has a clean and simple interface, which makes it easy to use. Bing and Yahoo also provide useful results, but sometimes the ads can be distracting. Ask had fewer relevant results compared to the others. This comparison showed me that the user interface and result quality are important when choosing a search engine. In the future, I will use Google or Bing for my searches because they provide better results and a better experience.

        Second, I practiced using search operators to improve my searches. For example, I searched the exact phrase "search engine market share" with and without quotation marks. The search with quotes gave me more precise results related to market share statistics. I also tried searching only on the Wikiversity website using the operator site:wikiversity.org. This helped me find more focused and relevant information compared to using Wikiversityâ€™s built-in search. Learning how to use these search operators will help me save time and find better information for my assignments or projects.

        Finally, I explored artificial intelligence by using ChatGPT. I created several queries and was impressed by how well ChatGPT understood my questions and gave clear answers. One interesting query I made was about the difference between AI and machine learning, and ChatGPT explained it in a simple way. Using AI tools like ChatGPT can help me study faster, get ideas, and solve problems more easily. I also learned about some risks related to large language models, which made me realize that AI is powerful but should be used carefully.

        Overall, these activities gave me useful skills in searching for information effectively, understanding how search engines work, and using new AI tools. I believe these skills will help me not only in this course but also in my future studies and work.
